# Link Shortener project

This is a simple clone of the bit.ly link shortener functionality.

This is a simple MEAN stack project, where we use a mongoDB database hosted on mlab in order to store a collection of long urls and short urls. It uses node.js as the server.

The front-end is mobile-responsive, using the CSS Grid system.

Technologies used:
- Node.js
- express
- mongoDB
- CSS Grids (Mobile Responsive)
- html
- Javascript with jquery and ajax requests

You need to add the username and password for your own mlab linkshortener database in order to make this project.
